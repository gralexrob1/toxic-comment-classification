# toxic-comment-classification

This competition aims to revolutionise the landscape of comment classification within online discourse. Participants will dive into the task of determining the toxicity of comments posted on various online articles. The ultimate goal is to build models that not only accurately identify toxic comments but also demonstrate robustness across diverse demographic subpopulations.

The primary objective of this challenge is to develop innovative solutions that mitigate biases inherent in comments mentioning specific demographic identities. Participants are tasked with crafting models that excel in fairness and accuracy across these demographic subpopulations, aiming for superior performance beyond mere overall averages.
